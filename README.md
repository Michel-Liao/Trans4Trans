### Introduction

We build upon a portable system based on the proposed Trans4Trans model, aiming to assist the people with visual impairment to correctly interact with general and transparent objects in daily living.

More details can be found in our paper on [[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03172)]. 

### Usage

The code and model weights will be release soon.
